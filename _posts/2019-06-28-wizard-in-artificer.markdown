## tl;dr
The 2019 revision of the Artificer is too limiting when it comes allowing players to be creative with crafting enchantments together into a unique magical item. So, I modified it to be something an engineer could love.

## Full Story
Let's start with a story, with a player we will call Ed.

It's the summertime, and some university friends and I wanted to play some 5th edition DnD while our main group was seperated by internships and responsibilities. I'm the usual DM, and I had a new setting in mind so we got to work building new characters for a sandbox-style 1st level campaign.

Ed was in town for the summer and so was joining for the campaign, taking a break from his usual Wizard to try something with less spells but still some complexity. After some discussions, the new Unearthed Arcana [Artificer](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/artificer-returns) was brought up and I pointed him towards the playtest document with some lore about the setting. The beginning of the Artificer document talks about the class as being the "masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects" and how magic is just a complex system to be decoded and put back together. However, as Ed expressed, it's really quite *limiting*.

As a general recap, the Artificer is a Intelligence-based half caster based around the mechanics of item infusions and being flexibile for any situation. Infusions are accomplished by the ability to learn a certain number of arcane infusions and being able to hold a certain number of them active at once as long as you're conscious. However, these are all **temporary**, and can be enchanted and disenchanted at the start of the day. This was most likely for balance purposes, as well as keeping the class simple enough to be playable by a large audience. Frankly, I think it's pretty good. It still allows for some creativity with what combinations you produce, as well as the flexibility to create what the party needs at the time.

Yet, as Ed pointed out, temporary enchantments isn't what comes to mind when flavorful passages about decoding magic and controlling it open the Artficer. What comes to mind is producing wack combinations of different enchantments found within the world to produce something really neat and unseen before. Now, for a general public release of the Artificer, this would be nearly impossible to keep it simple enough to be approachable as well as balanced with everything else. But, I know Ed's pretty smart, and it's a summer campaign in a magic heavy setting, so I was up for the challenge of producing something.

## Putting the Wizard in Artificer

[Link to Document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b54em8XuL_ILsIIz9qUGubGpeNFWaQBccPMKFH7E_ec/edit?usp=sharing)

On the document, the title of this post, and now this section, all use the phrase "Putting the Wizard in Artificer". Now what do I mean by that? Wizards are the arcane masters of the DnD world. They are the ones to make the actual spells, as evident by incantations such as *Leomund's* Tiny Hut, with Leomund being a wizard of the [Circle of Eight](https://greyhawk.fandom.com/wiki/Circle_of_Eight). So, putting the Wizard in Artificer means to give the Artificer class the license to make something never seen before.

I went about accomplishing this in a few ways. The first was to rework infusions to allow for the development of magic items. The next part was to make a quantative method for discovering magical properties in the world. Finally, there needed to be a way to create *permanent* magic items.

### Reworking Infusions and Magic Properties

Reworking infusions was the majority of the work. I ended up creating a new class feature called *Develop Magic Item*, which is gained at 2nd level along side *Infuse Item*. In addition to gaining this new feature, I completely removed *Replicate Magic Item* as an obtainable infusion, as this system would leave it obsolete.

Instead of just learning how to make items, like that with *Replicate Magic Item*, Artificers can instead learn properties in the natural world and apply them to a given "medium". Medium is used pretty vaguely here as I intentionally wanted to keep the options open to creativity. These properties are learned over time and only take up slots for your *Infusions Known* if you choose to take a property instead of one of the listed infusions (thinking of it similar to a Eureka-type discovery upon level up).

Properties would have a given rarity attached to them, allowing the system to restrict types of infusions to levels, which solves the issue of a 2nd level Artificer making a Very Rare infusions (slightly too broken, even for this system).

### Researching

Researching properties, mechanically, is based on the rarity. The high the rarity, the longer it takes and the more expensive it is. The curve of these with rarity are eyeballed psuedo-expoential and haven't been playtested yet. These as well could need to reflect the amount of money given in your campaign. As seen with lengths such as 60 days of intense research to learn a lengendary property, these can get pretty long. And if your players are anything like my players, they don't like sitting around for too long. So, the Artificer can double their investment in coinage in order to half the time requirement. This is limited to a cap of a quarter of the time, but it keeps the properties feeling more in reach if they feel downtime should be mitigated.

There is an additional section on learning the properties of "spells", so items such as wands can still be an option. Instead of time to research, I went with a number of casts observed requirement. This would represent the Artificer taking notes and applying systems to the properties of the spell until they are able to replicate it themselves within their infusions. Basing it on *observations* instead of *self-casting* has the added benefit that with enough persuasion, they could learn to replicate the spells of *other casters*.

I track these physically by giving Ed "research cards", which have a name, required cost and time for research, description, and infusion cost and time (more on that later). This allows him to keep track of his own use of downtime put into research without some obaque DM tracking.

### Infusing Items

Infusions themselves can come in two forms, temporary and permanent. Temporary works very similar to the current system, with the additional restriction of the level as mentioned above. For permanent solutions, the infusion process has a time and cost. These are expressed within two equations at the end of the document, but come down to the time being a sum of all the infusion times (the Artificer layering on enchantments), and the cost equaling the sum **if** they are "smart" enough to understand the order of operations. This is reflected in an increase in cost if they exceed a number of properties equal to half their intelligence rounded down. I did this mainly as a point of balancing, and I feel it should adjust itself well with their level.

### The Result and What I've Learned

We are about four sessions into the campaign, starting at 1st level, and due to our short time together I've been expediting leveling so they are already up to 4th level (see their level up rate?). So by now, Ed has already had some time with the new Infusion mechanisms and actually has a property or two under his belt, utilizing the Eureka mechanism when getting new *Infusion Known* slots with his level. Here's a few observations and takeaways about the mechanism as well as Artificer in general:

**Take Dexterity Artificer over Strength Artificer.** The quickstart section reccomends taking either Dexterity or Strength as your second highest stat since you are a half caster. Ed instantly went for Dexterity, and is now rocking two Hand Crossbows with the *Repeating Shot* infusion on them (deemed Lefty and Righty). This means he can dual wield them all while ignoring the Loading property on them, which is pretty badass.

**Infusions are only as broken as the items you include.** If you're worred about creating cool magic items that could be obused by a devious Artificer, the rarity of the items can be a game changer for balance. I made the mistake of including a pretty powerful weapon enchantment as an uncommon rarity, meaning Ed now has it on Lefty and is dealing way above his paygrade.

**This is kinda overpowered.** This might be a bit obvious, but allowing for the creation of permanent magic items, even if costly, is still pretty damn powerful in most settings. Magic Items in DnD 5e transcend expected encounter difficulties, meaning you will have to work a lot harder to keep up with your players damage output. There is also the talk of the expected amount of magic items you expect your players to have. If your campaign treats magic items as a rare occurance in the world, this system definitely isn't for you. But, if you're in a setting that has a pretty liberal approach to magical items and artifacts, and you have a player looking for some fun interacting with the magic in your world through something a bit more freeing, with some adjustments this could be a good fit.
